A dataset containing employee absenteeism data is cleaned and preprocessd before a logistic regression model is developed.
Using classes in python a python module is created to enable new similar datasets to be analysed.
The module is used on a new dataset and the predictions are saved into an SQL database by running SQL queries in Jupyter Notebook
The data and predictions are then visualized in Tabluea.
