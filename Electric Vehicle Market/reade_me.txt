With the increasing push for more sustainable solutions to living, the electric vehicle market has been growing at a rapid rate throughout the past few years. OEM's are releasing new electric vehicle models every year leading to a wider variety of options available to customers. Furthermore, the shift towards electrification may have left manufacturers with a difficult decision with regards to sell price of new models, especially with the incorporation of new technology such as batteries, battery recharge methods and more powerful electric motors. This project aims to acquire specification data on electric vehicle models currently in the market, clean, store and analyse this data; moreover, a neural network machine learning model will be trained to predict the selling price. The idea behind this project was to create a tool whereby vehicle manufacturers can enter electric vehicle specification data of a new model to understand what price they may be able achieve. Furthermore, this type of insight may be able to help manufacturers with managing cost of tooling, costs of sourcing parts from global OES suppliers and other costs associated with mass production of new vehicle models.

Now with the context of the project set it is worth discussing the data science content. The majority of this project is written in the python programming language and aims to detail the entire data science process as shown below:

Electric vehicle specification data is scraped from https://www.evspecifications.com/ using the selenium library in python. Furthermore, an api is used to collate data on exchange rates because the pricing data from the website is in multiple currencies and must be standardised. The api url: https://api.exchangerate.host/timeseries

The data is cleaned using the pandas library in python. Lots of the data is inconsistent between models on the website, hence a large portion of this section is addressing missing data. If there is too much missing data in a given column then it is removed; however, the strategy employed when filling in missing data is to group the data and use mean values of the groups

The cleaned data is then stored in a MySQL server database hosted on Amazon Web Services Relation Database platform (AWS RDS). This is to allow quick querying when moving forward with the project

Data analysis is conducted on the dataset by looking at the pricing distribution; categorical variables vs price; continuous variables vs price and other visualisations such as a correlation heat map. A dashboard is created using Micrsoft Power BI to visualise insight on the dataset. The link to the dashboard can be found here: https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYzcwYTZiNWQtYWFkNS00Mjk5LTljMDQtNGFjODVlMzRjNWZjIiwidCI6IjRkMWZhZjhhLTliNGYtNDExNS1iYWY4LWYzMTA2MjdmYzFmNyIsImMiOjh9 alternatively it can be found in the script or on the application web page

The TensorFlow Python package is used to build a neural net machine learning model that is trained on the dataset to predict vehicle price. The dataset has to be pre-processed before being input to the model such as converting categorical variables to dummy variables.

Flask library in python is used to deploy the machine learning model in a web applicaton. A website is created so that the model can be embedded in the webpage along with the power bi dashboard. The HTML file can be found on my Github page using the following link:

Lastly the model is deployed using AWS elastic bean stalk platform so that anyone online can use the model
